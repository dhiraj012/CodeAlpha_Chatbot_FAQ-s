# CodeAlpha_Chatbot_FAQ-s
### Chatbot FAQ System   A smart chatbot designed to simplify FAQ handling. Using natural language processing, the system accurately answers frequently asked questions, enhancing user experience and reducing response time. Perfect for customer support and educational platforms.
## Project Overview
This is a simple FAQ chatbot built using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to answer frequently asked questions (FAQs) about a particular product or topic. The chatbot is designed to answer user queries related to a specific subject, in this case, **laptop information**. It uses Python's `NLTK` (Natural Language Toolkit) for text processing and the `Tkinter` library for the Graphical User Interface (GUI).

### Key Features:
- **Natural Language Processing**: Uses tokenization and lemmatization to process user input.
- **FAQ Dataset**: A predefined set of frequently asked questions and their answers.
- **Graphical User Interface**: User-friendly interface using `Tkinter` for easy interaction.

## Installation

To run this project, follow the steps below to set up the environment.

### Prerequisites:
1. **Python 3.x** installed on your system.
2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install nltk tkinter

## Download Required NLTK Resources:
The chatbot uses NLTK's wordnet and punkt resources for text processing. You need to download them before running the project.

## python code
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('wordnet')

## How to Run the Chatbot
#### 1.Clone the repository or copy the project files to your local machine.
#### 2.Make sure you've installed all the necessary libraries and downloaded the NLTK resources.
#### 3.Run the chatbot.py file (or the file containing your chatbot code).
#### 4.The chatbot window will open, and you can start asking questions in the input field.
